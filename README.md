# Module12Challenge
Project that uses inquirer, mysql, and javascript to create a functioning employee tracker that can show employees with roles, departments as well as add new employee, role or department. You can also update employee roles. 

Currently having issues with departments and roles repeating, as well as only having a set amount of id numbers rather than it correlating to how many deparments/roles there are.
